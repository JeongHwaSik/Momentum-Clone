# Momentum-Clone Overview

In the Kakao-Clone project, I created a purely static webpage using HTML and CSS. However, real-world webpages provide more dynamic content using not only HTML and CSS but also a language called JavaScript. Intrigued by this, I wanted to explore creating a more dynamic webpage using JavaScript. Therefore, I attempted to clone code the Momentum extension provided by Chrome.
